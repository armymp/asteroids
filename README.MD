# Python Asteroids

A classic arcade-style space shooter game built with Pygame where players navigate through an asteroid field while trying to survive and destroy incoming asteroids.

## üéÆ Gameplay

- Control a triangular spaceship through a field of asteroids
- Shoot asteroids to break them into smaller pieces
- Avoid colliding with asteroids
- The game gets progressively more challenging as asteroids continue to spawn

## üïπÔ∏è Controls

- `W` - Move forward
- `S` - Move backward
- `A` - Rotate left
- `D` - Rotate right
- `SPACE` - Shoot

## üöÄ Features

- Smooth spaceship movement and rotation
- Asteroids split into smaller pieces when shot
- Progressive difficulty with continuous asteroid spawning
- Physics-based movement
- Collision detection
- Clean, vector-style graphics

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- Python 3.x
- Pygame 2.6.1
